## Architecture & Key Files

### Frontend (Expo)
- **Tabs**: `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` (NativeTabs routing)
- **Home Feed**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (PostCard component)
- **Directory**: `app/(tabs)/directory.tsx` (live count pills, role-based buttons)
- **Marketplace**: `app/(tabs)/marketplace.tsx` (suppliers row, product grid)
- **Supplier Store**: `app/supplier-store.tsx` (white background, no cart icon)
- **Create Post**: `app/(tabs)/create.tsx` (quick issue buttons for repair category)
- **Products**: `app/(tabs)/products.tsx` (supplier product management)

### Backend (Express/TypeScript)
- **Routes**: `server/routes.ts` (API endpoints)
- **Database**: `shared/schema.ts` (Drizzle ORM)
- **Products**: DELETE endpoint enhanced with Bunny cleanup + logging

### Components
- **PostCard**: `components/PostCard.tsx` (displays user avatar, category icons, media)
- **DirectoryMap**: Shows tech/supplier/teacher markers

## Image System (Bunny CDN)
- **Zone**: `arun-storage` 
- **CDN URL**: `https://arun-storage.b-cdn.net`
- **Storage**: Products stored as JSON array in `images` field
- **Parsing**: Handles JSON array, comma-separated, or plain string formats
- **Deletion**: Cleans up Bunny files on product delete

## Environment & Secrets
- `BUNNY_STORAGE_API_KEY` - Bunny CDN authentication
- `BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY` - Video streaming
- `BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID` - Video library
- `FAST2SMS_API_KEY` - SMS OTP fallback
- `GCP_SA_KEY` - Google Cloud credentials
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI integrations
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email delivery

## Critical Implementation Details

### Image Upload Flow
1. Frontend: Pick image → upload to `/api/upload` endpoint
2. Backend: Save to Bunny CDN, return URL
3. Store: URL saved in product `images` field (JSON array)
4. Display: Parse images, show in grid (fallback to placeholder)
5. Delete: Extract filename from URL, call Bunny DELETE API, then remove from DB

### Product Visibility
- All supplier products → products table → appear in MarketHub
- Supplier profile → filters products by userId
- Search/filters work across all products
- Images display identically in both locations

### Directory Live Count
- Fetches profiles every 10 seconds
- Shows online/total count (e.g. "3/10")
- Counts active users across all roles
- Auto-refresh while on directory tab

### Role-Based UI
- **Customers**: Chat button only on directory
- **Technicians**: Chat button only on directory
- **Suppliers**: Chat + Call buttons on directory
- **Teachers**: Chat + Call buttons on directory

## Deployment
- Backend deployed to Cloud Run (auto-updates with Deploy Backend workflow)
- Frontend deployed to Firebase Hosting (auto-updates with Deploy Frontend workflow)
- Database: PostgreSQL (Replit managed)

## Notes
- **Scratchpad items** maintained in session history (phone numbers, admin routes, etc.)
- Fast mode completed most critical features in 10 turns
- Some lower-priority items (map markers, insurance plan IMEI) left for future focused tasks
- All image handling is robust with fallback parsing

## Desktop WebView Mode (New Feature)

**Implementation**: In-app web pages automatically display in desktop view.

**Component**: `components/DesktopWebView.tsx`
- Desktop Chrome user agent (Windows 10, Chrome 120)
- Wide viewport (1024px) forces desktop layout
- Scales properly on mobile screen with pinch-zoom
- Injects CSS to hide mobile-only elements
- No external browser opening - stays in app

**Routing**: `lib/open-link.ts` handles all link opens
- Internal links → `/webview` screen with DesktopWebView
- Tel/mailto/sms links → native handlers
- Web platform → opens in new tab

**Applies To**:
- Shop pages
- Profile pages  
- External website links
- Live sessions
- Payment pages

**User Experience**:
- Similar to Chrome's "Desktop Site" feature
- Automatic (no manual toggle)
- Full app navigation (back button)
- Loading indicators and error handling
